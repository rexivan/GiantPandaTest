<h1>Giant Panda</h1>

<p>
    The small panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),[5] also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear[6] native to south central China.[1] 
    It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. 
    The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. 
    Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.
